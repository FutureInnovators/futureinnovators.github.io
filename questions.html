      Pitch competitions are a place to present your business plans. They provide an opportunity for entrepreneurs to access feedback, funding, and networking to advance their business ventures. Several teams or individuals present their ideas to experienced
      judges and receive constructive feedback with the goal of improving and actualizing these business platforms.
