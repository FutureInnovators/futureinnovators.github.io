    Pitch competitions are a place to present your business ideas. They provide an opportunity for entrepreneurs to receive feedback, funding, and networking to advance their business ventures. Several teams or individuals present their ideas to experienced judges and receive constructive feedback with the goal of identifying opportunities and launching new ventures.
